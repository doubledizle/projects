# Introduction

A Simple ToDo App is built using the MVC Architecture, we have also implemented "authorization" so folx can sign up, customize & personalize the app

# Objectives

- It's a beginner level app created to understand how MVC concept and logins are added

---

# Who is this for? 

- It's for beginners & intermediates with little more experience, to help understand the various aspects of building a node app with some complex features

---

# Packages/Dependencies used 

bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

---

# Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

# Things to add

- Create a `.env` file in the config folder and add the following as `key: value` 
  - PORT: 2121 (can be any port example: 3000) 
  - DB_STRING: `your database URI`

CHATTER:

Tested the app locally instead of replit and it works! Woo! Login, sign up, adding items, deleting items, logging out all work correctly.

re: Interesting. I wonder what the issue is getting it to work on Replit. Maybe we can just collab on ideas/code here and clone it down for testing/final product. I tried setting up a CodePen Pro for collaboration, but it doesn't appear to support Full Stack apps very well, at least from what I can tell.- Donny

Melinna had an idea of setting up a Discord for easier collaboration as well, which I agree with. I think it will make working on things a bit easier if y'all are down for it. I'll have time to work on it this weekend to add features, etc. Also, there's a chat window in the bottom right that I just noticed! - Donny

I commented out the js files. Please feel free to correct my spelling or wording for better descriptions. - Kevin discord KevinTap#0955

Something I do commonly with my code for server.js is log to the console localhost:${process.env.PORT} so that I don't have to go digging for the port.
I added this to the app.listen. - Kevin discord KevinTap#0955

In the css file I noticed the background color was shrinking behind the h1. I changed the width: 20% to min-width:20% to prevent this. I added a media query for mobile screen size 440px and under to resize the main header Shoppin' It font size. I'd like to change the layout of the form inputs aswell. - Kevin discord KevinTap#0955

In the todos.ejs I changed the h1 to Shopping List so that the todos page title says Shopping List and added padding: 5px so that the lowercase p would not exceed the background color. I put the user name to caps on the h2 using .toUpperCase() and changed the contents to say things left to shop for. I changed the form placeholder to say Enter grocery item. - Kevin discord KevinTap#0955

# Melinna: 
Ok, I got it all to work. So Replit's "Webview" tab is...well it's trash. So open the webview in a new window (on the Webview, it's the 3rd button to the left of the URL) and you will be able to either create a new user or log in. 

 I got the actual list CSS to work now as well. 

 ok, so I updated some CSS, and fixed some minor issues. All should be working. If not, message me on discord Rupert#6112.
